# Supported values as of today:
# 0_10_X_WT901: Use this if you have an WT901 and have a 0.10.x mainboard.
# 0_10_X_MPU9250: Use this if you have an MPU9250 and have a 0.10.x mainboard (be aware that there are many fake chips on the market. So probably not your hardware version).
# 0_9_X_WT901_INSTEAD_OF_SOUND: Use this if you have soldered the WT901 in the sound module's slot and have a 0.9.x mainboard.
# 0_9_X_MPU9250: Use this if you have an MPU9250 and have a 0.9.x mainboard (be aware that there are many fake chips on the market. So probably not your hardware version).

# Relative Positioning vs LatLng coordinates
# If OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=False, we're using an arbitrary point as map origin. This point is called the DATUM point and
# needs to be set using OM_DATUM_LAT and OM_DATUM_LONG below.
# If OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=True, we're using the ublox NAVRELPOSNED messages as position.
# This makes your base station the map origin
# For it recommended to set OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION to False. This way you can move your base station without re-recording your maps and it's also more compatible overall.
export OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=False

# If needed, uncomment and set to coordinates near you (these default coordinates are somewhere in Germany).
