# Most of the time you must modify those settings, so they are moved to the beginning of document from their respective sections
# Refer to documentation for more info: https://openmower.de/docs/robot-assembly/prepare-the-parts/prepare-sd-card/#step-2-configure-open-mower

# Your Hardware Version (more a firmware version, really). Check the OpenMower docs (https://openmower.de/docs/versions/) for the firmware versions.
# Supported values as of today:
# 0_13_X: Use this if you have 0.13.x mainboard with LSM6DSOTR (default).
# 0_12_X_LSM6DSO: Use this if you have an LSM6DSOTR and have a 0.12.x mainboard.
# 0_11_X_WT901: Use this if you have an WT901 and have a 0.11.x mainboard.
# 0_10_X_WT901: Use this if you have an WT901 and have a 0.10.x mainboard.
# 0_10_X_MPU9250: Use this if you have an MPU9250 and have a 0.10.x mainboard (be aware that there are many fake chips on the market. So probably not your hardware version).
# 0_9_X_WT901_INSTEAD_OF_SOUND: Use this if you have soldered the WT901 in the sound module's slot and have a 0.9.x mainboard.
# 0_9_X_MPU9250: Use this if you have an MPU9250 and have a 0.9.x mainboard (be aware that there are many fake chips on the market. So probably not your hardware version).

# Uncomment and set to coordinates near your future docking station, this will be your map origin.
# There might be a case that you don't need those if you using OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=True

# NTRIP Settings
# Set to False if using external radio plugged into the Ardusimple board.

## Hardware Specific Settings ##
################################

# The type of mower you're using, used to get some hardware parameters automatically
# Currently supported:
# YardForce500
# YardForceSA650
# CUSTOM (put your configs in ~/mower_params/)
export OM_MOWER="YardForce500"

# Select your ESC type
# Supported values as of today:
# xesc_mini: for the STM32 version (VESC)
# xesc_2040: for the RP2040 version (very experimental!)
export OM_MOWER_ESC_TYPE="xesc_mini"

# Select your gamepad
# Currently supported: ps3, steam_stick, steam_touch, xbox360
export OM_MOWER_GAMEPAD="xbox360"

# Set to true to record your session.
# Output will be stored in your $HOME
# export OM_ENABLE_RECORDING_ALL=False

################################
##        GPS Settings        ##
################################
# Relative Positioning vs LatLng coordinates
# If OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=False, we're using an arbitrary point as map origin. This point is called the DATUM point and
# needs to be set using OM_DATUM_LAT and OM_DATUM_LONG below.
# If OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=True, we're using the ublox NAVRELPOSNED messages as position.
# This makes your base station the map origin
# For it recommended to set OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION to False. This way you can move your base station without re-recording your maps and it's also more compatible overall.
export OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=False

# GPS protocol. Use UBX for u-blox chipsets and NMEA for everything else
export OM_GPS_PROTOCOL=UBX

# If you use a different gps board you maybe want to set a different baudrate.
export OM_GPS_BAUDRATE="921600"

# If you want to use F9R's sensor fusion, set this to true (you will also need to set DATUM_LAT and DATUM_LONG).
# Consider this option unstable, since I don't have the F9R anymore, so I'm not able to test this.
# IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS, SET IT TO FALSE
