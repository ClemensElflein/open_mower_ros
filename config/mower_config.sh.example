# Most of the time you must modify those settings, so they are moved to the beginning of document from their respective sections
# Refer to documentation for more info: https://openmower.de/docs/robot-assembly/prepare-the-parts/prepare-sd-card/#step-2-configure-open-mower

# Your Hardware Version (more a firmware version, really). Check the OpenMower docs (https://openmower.de/docs/versions/) for the firmware versions.
# Supported values as of today:
# 0_13_X: Use this if you have 0.13.x mainboard with LSM6DSOTR (default).
# 0_12_X_LSM6DSO: Use this if you have an LSM6DSOTR and have a 0.12.x mainboard.
# 0_11_X_WT901: Use this if you have an WT901 and have a 0.11.x mainboard.
# 0_10_X_WT901: Use this if you have an WT901 and have a 0.10.x mainboard.
# 0_10_X_MPU9250: Use this if you have an MPU9250 and have a 0.10.x mainboard (be aware that there are many fake chips on the market. So probably not your hardware version).
# 0_9_X_WT901_INSTEAD_OF_SOUND: Use this if you have soldered the WT901 in the sound module's slot and have a 0.9.x mainboard.

# Ignore Charging Current
# If you're affected by a wrong IC2 sourcing, read here https://openmower.de/docs/versions/errata/ic2-is-wrong/
# for more details, you can disable the wrong charging current reading by disabling the charging protection via:
#export OM_IGNORE_CHARGING_CURRENT=True

# Full Sound Support - But read on carefully:
# Up to (and inclusive) OM hardware version 0.13.x, DFPlayer's power supply is set by default to 3.3V.
# This is done by solder jumper "JP1" whose board track is by default at 3.3V.
# If you manually opened the 3.3V track and solder a bridge to 5V, then you can indicate it here to get full sound support.
# DO NOT enable "OM_DFP_IS_5V=True" if you haven't changed it in real. You might risk your "Raspberry Pico"!
# And even if the Pico isn't expensive, it's a torture to replace it.
# Full details are available here: https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower/blob/main/Firmware/LowLevel/README-Sound%2C%20DFPIS5V.md
# export OM_DFP_IS_5V=False
#
# Language as ISO-639-1 code string (currently only used by sound).
# Supported languages: en|de
# export OM_LANGUAGE="en"
#
# Sound volume (%)
# Supported values:
# 0-100 = Set sound volume on OM start, ignoring a previously set volume level (i.e. changed by CoverUI)
#    -1 = Don't change a previously set volume level
# export OM_VOLUME=-1
#
# Background sounds
# Beside some spoken informational advert sounds like "Waiting for RTK GPS" or "Heading back to docking station",
# the current sound implementation might also play some funny background sounds like "I'm singing in the rain" once rain got detected.
# But it will also play background sounds which might unsettle your wife or neighbor.
# That's why it's configured false/off by default. If your wife or neightbor is heavy-duty, you can set it to "true" (on) here:
# export OM_BACKGROUND_SOUNDS=False

# Relative Positioning vs LatLng coordinates

# needs to be set using OM_DATUM_LAT and OM_DATUM_LONG below.
# If OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=True, we're using the ublox NAVRELPOSNED messages as position.
# This makes your base station the map origin
# For it recommended to set OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION to False. This way you can move your base station without re-recording your maps and it's also more compatible overall.
export OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION=False

# GPS protocol. Use UBX for u-blox chipsets and NMEA for everything else
export OM_GPS_PROTOCOL=UBX

# If you use a different gps board setup you maybe want to set a different port and/or baudrate.
# For example to use an Ardusimple simpleRTK with USB connection:
# OM_GPS_PORT="/dev/serial/by-id/usb-u-blox_AG_-_www.u-blox.com_u-blox_GNSS_receiver-if00"
# You can obtain your usb gps path by executing "ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/*" and look for your gps there.
# export OM_GPS_BAUDRATE="921600"
# export OM_GPS_PORT="/dev/..."

# If you want to use F9R's sensor fusion, set this to true (you will also need to set DATUM_LAT and DATUM_LONG).
# Consider this option unstable, since I don't have the F9R anymore, so I'm not able to test this.
# IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS, SET IT TO FALSE
export OM_USE_F9R_SENSOR_FUSION=False

# Instead of communicating with the serial port socket directly, GPS data can be read from a TCP port.

# it to -1 or -2.
# Set OM_DOCKING_DISTANCE to the number of meters, that must be travelled along

# On the other hand do not add too much, as this value is a security measure used
# to stop the motor, if the mower does not hit the station exactly and tries to

# The ESCs can be placed in a low power mode to reduce power usage/heat while in the dock or
# during emergency.

# Hall / Emergency input configuration
#
# This is an expert configuration option, use it only for custom builds!
# The normal YardForce Classic 500 user should leave all options in commented state.
#
# We do have 10 emergency inputs. 4 * OM-Hall1 up to OM-Hall4, plus 6 * Stock-CoverUI.
#
# Each emergency input can be configure in one of the following modes:
# I = Ignore this input. Use this mode for inputs which aren't connected to any sensor, or if you wish that this sensor get ignored
# U = Undefined (don't touch this input, leave it as it's by default)
# S = Stop. This input shall be used as "Stop" button input
# L = Lift. Use for an input with lift and tilt support like for wheel sensors
#
# In addition, each mode letter, can be prefixed with a "!" character, which indicate that this sensor shall be handled as "low-active" sensor
#
# All sensors which shall be configured, have to be placed in a comma separated list in the following order:
#   OM-Hall1, OM-Hall2, OM-Hall3, OM-Hall4
# If you've a FW-Moded Stock-CoverUI up to CoverUI FW 2.0x, with attached sensors/buttons, you can append the list with the following inputs:
#   CoverUI-LIFT|LIFTX, Ignore, CoverUI-LBUMP|RBUMP, Ignore, CoverUI-Stop1, CoverUI-Stop2
# For those with a CoverUI FW as of 2.1x the appendable list of inputs is:
#   CoverUI-LIFT, CoverUI-LIFTX, CoverUI-LBUMP, CoverUI-RBUMP, CoverUI-Stop1, CoverUI-Stop2
#
# Here's an example of a standard Classic 500 configuration where the sensors got attached as documented,
# which is Hall1+2 to the front wheel-lift sensors, and Hall3+4 to the top cover stop-button halls:
# export OM_EMERGENCY_INPUT_CONFIG="!L, !L, !S, !S"
# Yes, "!x" (low-active), because Classic 500 models, pull the input to low when they get triggered (whereas all CoverUI signals are "high-active")
#
#export OM_EMERGENCY_INPUT_CONFIG=""
#
# Lift period, to filter uneven ground
# Period (ms) for >=2 wheels to be lifted in order to count as emergency (0 = disable)
#export OM_EMERGENCY_LIFT_PERIOD="100"
#
# Tilt period, to filter uneven ground
# Period (ms) for a single wheel to be lifted in order to count as emergency (0 = disable)
